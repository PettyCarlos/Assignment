     My name is Keron Hunter and I am originally from Jamaica but reside in Hayward, California.  I have decided to do a career change from the finance profession and currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Networking and Information Technology. I am currently enrolled in the CNIT 132 class at the City College of San Francisco which is intermediate HTML and CSS-501. The reason why I am doing this class is to learn new skills and to upgrade and enhance my career. Thus far, I have learned how to make a basic web page using HTML5 which is the standard markup language. It is the most basic building block you'll need for developing websites.  In addition to that, I have learned how to create the pageâ€™s layout, color, fonts, and style using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). </p>
     
           
     <p> 
         My path in the Web development field thus far has been slow but very good. I have always from a tender age been interested in computers and how websites are built but never gotten the chance to pursue a career due to my love for numbers and eventually deviated into the finance world. After accomplishing my degree in Finance and Banking I realised that wasn't the career path for me and here I am now currently taking classes to become a web developer.  <a href="https://www.fabriziovanmarciano.com/design-and-developer-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Web Developer Websites To Follow To Improve Your Skills:</a> The link provided is one of my favortie websites due to the fact it speaks to the different websites that can be of assistance to beginners just as myself. I must say that this website has helped me tremendously along with the CNIT 132 class. For example, the website recommended me to use github which is a community driven development platform where you can learn new techniques from over 23 million developers, as well as share your own knowledge and resources.</p>
